# Configure TLS-inspecting proxies

The Grok Bot desktop app connects from each member's device to two places: Cursor's API at `*.cursor.sh` for chat, sign-in, and approvals, and the member's hosted computer at a nested `*.*.cursorvm.com` hostname for computer setup, screen, and shell. Secure web gateways that inspect TLS often let the first through and break the second. The desktop app then hangs or errors during computer setup; in some setups chat keeps working while the computer never connects. Zscaler is the most common example, and this page uses it for specifics; the same steps apply to any gateway that re-signs TLS or buffers responses. This page is for the IT team that runs your gateway. The shared domain list and streaming tests live on [Enterprise network configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration.md); this page covers what Grok Bot adds.

This page is about the path from a member's device to Cursor. It doesn't
change where the hosted computer itself may connect; that is the
[network policy](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/security.md#network-policy). Reaching services
on your private network from the computer is covered in
[Connect to private networks](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/private-networks.md).

## Symptoms

- **Computer setup hangs or fails.** The app never finishes connecting to the computer. Chat may keep working, since it can reach `api2.cursor.sh`, or stall along with it; either way, the computer link needs `cursorvm.com`.
- **It works on a hotspot or a personal device** and fails on the corporate network or with the gateway client running.
- **It works in the office and fails at home.** The exceptions were applied to the office location only. See [apply to every profile](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/proxies.md#apply-to-every-profile-including-off-network).
- **Sign-in or chat stall too.** TLS inspection or response buffering is still active on `cursor.sh`.

## Allow these domain patterns

Allow all of these on the gateway and in any DNS filtering. Prefer the wildcards over enumerating hostnames; computer hostnames are generated per computer.

| Pattern                              | Used for                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*.cursor.sh`                        | Chat, sign-in, approvals, and the rest of the Cursor API |
| `*.cursor-cdn.com`                   | Static assets                                            |
| `*.cursorapi.com`                    | Extension marketplace and related APIs                   |
| `*.cursorvm.com`                     | The hosted computer and its control plane                |
| `*.*.cursorvm.com`                   | The same, one level deeper. Required.                    |
| `cursor.com`, `downloads.cursor.com` | Installing and updating the desktop app                  |

Add both `cursorvm.com` patterns. Computer hostnames have two labels below
`cursorvm.com`, in the form `<computer>.<cluster>.cursorvm.com`, and a
single-level wildcard matches only one. A gateway configured with
`*.cursorvm.com` alone looks correct and still leaves the computer
unreachable. This is the usual cause of computer setup failing on a
network where `cursor.sh` is already allowed.

## Exempt the same domains from TLS inspection and buffering

Allowing the traffic isn't enough. On every domain above:

- **Bypass TLS (SSL) inspection.** When the gateway re-signs the connection with its own certificate, the computer setup handshake fails even though the hostname is allowed. Cursor's connections are already encrypted end to end.
- **Turn off response buffering.** Chat and the computer link stream. A gateway that holds responses until they complete leaves the app waiting on output that never arrives.

If your policy requires inspecting all traffic, the gateway must meet the requirements under [SSL inspection and DLP](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration.md#ssl-inspection-and-dlp): HTTP/2 or Cursor's HTTP/1.1 fallback, Server-Sent Events passthrough without buffering, and long-lived connections without forced timeouts.

## Apply to every profile, including off-network

Zscaler Client Connector keeps running when a device leaves the office, and it applies an off-network profile of its own. Exceptions added to the office location or to a single policy don't follow the device home. Apply the allow rules, the TLS inspection exemption, and any DNS exception to every location, profile, and policy group that Grok Bot members fall under, including roaming and off-network. Other gateways with separate on- and off-network policies need the same treatment.

The tell: Grok Bot works from the office and fails from home on the same laptop, with the gateway client still running.

## Verify from a member's device

Run these on a member's device with the gateway client running, after IT has applied the changes.

### Check who issues the certificate

```bash
curl -v https://api2.cursor.sh |& grep -C1 issuer:
```

The issuer should be **Amazon RSA**. If it names Zscaler or your gateway
vendor, TLS inspection is still active on `cursor.sh` for this device's
profile.

### Check that computer hostnames resolve

```bash
nslookup test.us9.cursorvm.com
```

You should get addresses back. If the lookup fails, try
`nslookup test.us9.cursorvm.com 1.1.1.1`. If the public resolver answers
and your default one doesn't, the block is the device's DNS or gateway
profile, and the nested `*.*.cursorvm.com` exception is missing there.

### Test streaming

Run the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 streaming tests under
[Testing proxy connectivity](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration.md#testing-proxy-connectivity).
Output should arrive line by line, not all at once.

### Retry in the app

Open the Grok Bot desktop app on the same device and connect to the
computer. If it still fails, repeat the checks from that device; a
passing hotspot and a failing corporate network confirms the network is
the cause.

## Scope

Three controls are easy to confuse:

| You want to                                                                    | Use                                                                                                                                     |

By default, the hosted computer's own traffic leaves from Cursor's [shared static egress IPs](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/security.md#static-egress-ips) and doesn't pass through the gateway on member devices. When a member enables **Route traffic through this computer**, routed traffic uses that device's network and is subject to its gateway policy.

## FAQ

### We allowlisted \*.cursorvm.com. Why does computer setup still fail?

Two usual reasons. The nested `*.*.cursorvm.com` pattern is missing, so
the computer's hostname doesn't match. Or the domain is allowed but still
TLS-inspected, so the gateway's certificate breaks the setup handshake.
Add the nested pattern, exempt both patterns from inspection, then run
the [checks](https://cursor.com/docs/grok-bot/proxies.md#verify-from-a-members-device).

### We allowed cursor.sh. Why doesn't that cover the computer?

They use different hostnames. Chat, sign-in, and approvals go to
`api2.cursor.sh`, which most gateways already allow. The computer link
goes to a nested `cursorvm.com` hostname that needs its own allow rule
and inspection exemption. That is also why chat can keep working on some
networks while the computer never connects.

### It works in the office but not from home. What's different?

The gateway client is still running at home, with an off-network
profile that didn't get the exceptions. Apply them to the roaming and
off-network profiles too.

### Our policy requires TLS inspection on all traffic.

Then the gateway has to pass streaming through untouched. The
requirements are under
[SSL inspection and DLP](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration.md#ssl-inspection-and-dlp).
Exempting Cursor's domains is the reliable path; Cursor's connections
are encrypted end to end already.

### Does this list also cover the Cursor editor?

Yes. It's the same list as
[Enterprise network configuration](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/network-configuration.md#ip-allowlisting).
The editor's chat and Tab features work without the `cursorvm.com`
patterns, which is why a gateway that is fine for the editor can still
break Grok Bot.
